    - ???
    - JavaScript meme of some kind

- A brief (comical) history of JavaScript
    - In May 1995, Brendan Eich designed and wrote what would become JAvaScript in 10 days
    - And it shows...
    - NEtscape + Sun
    - Complement Java and should have a similar syntax
    - Ultimately led to a lot of confusion

    - JavaScript characteristics
        - Functional and prototypal
        - Nothing like the language it shared a name with
        - What we actually write is ECMA script
        - Hardly rolls off the tongue
        - TC39?

    - Basic WAT stuff
        - Type coercion and equality blah blah
        - Operator precedence problems

 NB: Need to introduce == and === and array and object at this point in time!

    - OO was all the hype
        - Classes
        - Inheritence
        - Enscapsulation
        - 'Functions' ancient aliens meme

    - Percieved 'weirdness'
        - Haunted JS for years.

- Rules of engagement
    - Global support vs 'big 4'
    - Honest about use cases (in reference to supporting old browsers)
    - Collective responsibility for future proofing?

- Variables
    - var foo = 'bar';
    - Block vs function scoping and Hoisting
    - Where do I fit in string interpolation?!

- Arrays and Looping
    - for / for in / for of / foreach() / map()
    - for
        - variable initialisation is a 'special' case
        - ++ isn't at the end, runs at the start except for the first one

- This
    - This, functions, arrow functions, and class

- Modules!!!
    - Import, Export, Export default
    - module, nomodule
    - dynamic import

- Inheritence?? Nah

- Promises, async and await.

- Notable apis?
    - Fetch
    - Maybe I should drop this?

- Transpilation (TypeScript or Babel)
